# Origin Frontend Take-Home Assignment

Origin is a platform that helps our customers' employees put their financial lives on track.

One key to financial well-being is planning & saving for your goals. Users can have many saving goals (e.g. go to college or throw a wedding party) and it is our job to help them accomplish it.

You will build a piece of our savings feature by creating the the saving plan simulation screen.

## The Saving Goal Plan Simulation Screen

You will build a screen where the user will simulate saving towards the "go to college" saving goal.

In it, the users choose (i) the value they want to save and (ii) the date they plan to reach the goal.

When the users change the value of any of the inputs, the monthly deposit value is calculated and displayed to them.

## Instructions

We expect you to:

1. Develop the page as close as possible to the mockups, both on mobile & desktop.
2. Implement business rules.
3. Test the codebase.

We've added a project structure (build system with react, redux, jest, styled-components and typescript) so you don't waste your time with configuration. If you are more comfortable with a different stack, feel free to change it.
